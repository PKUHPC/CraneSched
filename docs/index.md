## Architecture

![CraneSched architecture](images/Architecture.png)

CraneSched introduces a Resource Manager to support both HPC and AI workloads:

- HPC jobs: the Cgroup Manager allocates resources and provides cgroup-based isolation.
- AI jobs: the Container Manager uses Kubernetes for resource allocation and container lifecycle management.

---

## CLI Reference

- User commands: [cbatch](command/cbatch.md), [cqueue](command/cqueue.md), [crun](command/crun.md), [calloc](command/calloc.md), [cinfo](command/cinfo.md)
- Admin commands: [cacct](command/cacct.md), [cacctmgr](command/cacctmgr.md), [ceff](command/ceff.md), [ccontrol](command/ccontrol.md), [ccancel](command/ccancel.md)
- Exit codes: [reference](reference/exit_code.md)
