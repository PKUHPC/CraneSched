# Introduction #

[[中文](./README.md) | English]

**CraneSched** is an open-source distributed scheduler for HPC and AI workloads, developed by the High-Performance Computing (HPC) Public Platform at Peking University. It covers the core needs of job scheduling: resource management and monitoring, job submission/query, and resource isolation. The backend is implemented in C++, and the frontend in Go.

We welcome community contributions.

**Frontend**: [CraneSched-FrontEnd](https://github.com/PKUHPC/CraneSched-FrontEnd)

**Backend**: [CraneSched](https://github.com/PKUHPC/CraneSched)

**Documentation**: <https://pkuhpc.github.io/CraneSched/>

**Demo cluster** (test account: demo_admin / demo_admin): <https://hpc.pku.edu.cn/demo/cranesched>

# Highlights #

- **Performance**: >100,000 scheduling decisions per second
- **Scalability**: Scales to million-core clusters
- **Usability**: Simple user and admin commands
- **Security**: RBAC and encrypted communication
- **Resilience**: Automatic job recovery, no SPOF, fast state recovery
- **Open Source**: All code available

# Architecture #

**Cranectld** is the control plane: manages node lifecycles, schedules queues, manages resources, and processes job submission/modification/query.

**Craned** runs on compute nodes: monitors resources and job status, receives user commands, forwards them to Cranectld, and returns results.

CraneSched introduces a **Resource Manager** to support both HPC and AI workloads:

- For **HPC jobs**: the **Cgroup Manager** allocates resources and isolates jobs via cgroups.
- For **AI jobs**: the **Container Manager** allocates resources with Kubernetes, packages apps into containers, and manages their lifecycle.

# Application Scenarios #

CraneSched serves mixed HPC + AI workloads across distributed clusters. Clusters can be connected via cloud, and the scheduler places jobs on the most available cluster to improve utilization and reduce wait time.
